# cardshuffle
Show card deck order after each shuffle. Currently supports in and out farro shuffles.

To do:
1. Allow user defined starting order
2. Make diamonds show up red ♦️ (Why does it work for hearts but not diamonds?????)
3. Find a way to show centre card (done implicitly by item 6. Always first card of 3rd row)
4. Error handling
5. Indicate when deck order is back to starting order
6. Format card order display (done)
